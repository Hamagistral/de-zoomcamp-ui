### 🎯 Motivation :

The DE Zoomcamp UI project was born out of the need for a more accessible and organized learning experience for the **DE Zoomcamp Course by DataTalksClub**. As a student eager to dive into data engineering and learn modern technologies like Google Cloud, Docker, Terraform, Prefect, Spark, Kafka and more, I found it tiring to navigate through the course materials on GitHub and YouTube. Inspired by the clean and intuitive UI of CS50, I decided to create a simplified interface that brings together all the course resources in one place. This streamlit app aims to provide a user-friendly and streamlined experience, making it easier for learners like me to explore the course, answer homework questions directly in the app, and gain hands-on experience with data engineering technologies. By sharing this project, I hope to help others on their journey to becoming skilled data engineers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Easy navigation:** Access course materials, READMEs, YouTube videos, and homework assignments with a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Interactive learning:** Experiment with code examples, answer homework questions, and check their answers directly from the web app.
- **Clean and inspired design:** UI inspiration from the popular CS50 course, the UI provides a clean and enjoyable learning experience.

## 🚨 Disclaimer

This UI is created by a student as a personal project to facilitate personal learning and is not officially affiliated with DataTalksClub or the DE Zoomcamp course. All course materials and resources belong to their respective owners.
